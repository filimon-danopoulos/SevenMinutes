#Seven Minute workout

Apparently there is a thing called a seven minute workout. I don't exercise but I thought it would be a fun exercise (haha, yes?)
to write an application instructing you on how the workout should be done.


#History

I have actually already written the application, but since my Ubuntu One sync messed up and the source was lost I will rewrite it.
The application was in for some refactoring anyhow and since it is a small project I figured I might as well redo the whole thing.


#Contribution
I have absolutely no idea how you should get this project to work if you want to clone it. I am not a Java-developer so
the environment is confusing and alien. I used IntelliJ IDEA version 12.1.4 if that is of any help. Don't bother me with
questions regarding how to get things up and running because I would probably not know the answer.

#License and the like

The project is release under an MIT license. Do with it as you please. The only reason I choose this particular license
is that it was the only one short enough for me to read in a couple of minutes. If you do use the code I would appreciate it
if you would mentioned where you found it.
